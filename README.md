# Maven Commonly Used Commands
Here are some commonly used commands:
- `mvn clean`: Cleans the build artifacts generated by Maven, such as compiled classes, test results, and packaged files. It prepares the project for a fresh build.
- `mvn compile`: Compiles the source code of the project. It generates the compiled classes in the target directory.
- `mvn test`: Runs the tests in the project. It executes the tests and reports the results.
- `mvn package`: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as a JAR file or a WAR file, depending on the project type.
- `mvn install`: Installs the project artifacts into the local Maven repository. This makes the artifacts available for other projects or modules that depend on them.
- `mvn dependency:tree`: Displays the dependency tree of the project. It shows the hierarchical list of all the project dependencies and their transitive dependencies.
- `mvn clean install`: Combines both the clean and install goals. It first cleans the project, then builds and installs the artifacts into the local repository.
